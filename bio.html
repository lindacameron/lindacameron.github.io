		 		<h1>About Me</h1>

		 		<h2>A little bit about me</h2>
		 		<p>Hey! I'm Linda and I am a Junior at Tufts in the School of Engineering from Long Island, NY <BR>and I love learning and problem-solving!</p>

		 		<h2>What am I studying?</h2>
		 		<p>I'm studying Computer Science and Human Factors Engineering. I'm also interested in marketing <BR>and advertising, so I am taking many classes in that realm. I love the problem-solving aspect of <BR>CS, and I have always been interested in the design of things, which is why I think this <BR>duo of majors is perfect for me.</p>

		 		<h2>What are my skills?</h2>
		 		<p>I know C, C++, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript right now, but I am beginning to learn python and a bunch of front-end frameworks. I also know how to use Adobe Illustrator and Sketch to design cool things!</p>


		 		<h2>What are my interests?</h2>
		 		<p>I'm really interested in marketing and advertising, product design and global affairs. I also really love <BR>running, cooking, traveling, and being outside!</p>
