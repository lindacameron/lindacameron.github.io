	<h1>Blog Two: Task Analysis</h1>

	<p>	This week in class we discussed task analysis, which is basically breaking down a system or a task down to its smallest parts. As a class, we completed a task analysis on changing a flat tire. Though, my knowledge on how to change a flat tire is pretty limited, after doing the exercise I realized how important and helpful it can be to do a task analysis to truly understand what must be done in a task. I also learned how and how crucial it is to not miss any steps. <br><br>

	A task analysis can virtually be performed on any task. Below is an example of a task analysis done on making toast with peanut butter.

	<div class = "pb_toast">
		<img src="pb_toast.jpg" alt="PB on Toast">
	</div>
</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Walk to pantry to get bread and peanut butter</li>
		<li>Search for bread and peanut butter</li>
		<li>Get bread and PB from pantry and place on kitchen counter.</li>
		<li>Get a plate out of the cupboard</li>
		<li>Open bread package, take a piece of bread out, put bread on plate, close bread package</li>
		<li>Plug in toaster (That is conveniently on kitchen counter)</li>
		<li>Put bread into toaster</li>
		<li>Turn toaster knob to desired toast level</li>
		<li>Push down lever to toast bread</li>
		<li>Get a butter knive, put on plate</li>
		<li>Wait for bread to toast and pop out</li>
		<li>When toast pops out, check to make sure it is toasted enough</li>
		<li>Put toast on plate</li>
		<li>Open PB jar</li>
		<li>Scoop out PB with knife</li>
		<li>Spread PB on toast with knife until enough PB is on</li>
		<li>Eat!</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
	Though this task analysis is quite detailed (maybe overly detailed), it shows how many steps are needed to complete simple tasks. Who knew there could be 17 whole steps to making a piece of toast with peanut butter! I think that a task analysis is very useful for redesigning systems, so that a designer can easily determine what needs to be done for a task to be completed, where humans can make errors, and where human interaction can be minimized.
