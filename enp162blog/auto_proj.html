	<h1>Automation Project</h1>

	<p>For this project, we were tasked with automating some part of our websites. I decided to use Google Analytics to automate my site, and I added HTML scripts to allow this to happen. By adding this code to my site, I will be able to see what type of people are visiting my site, when they visit, and which pages they viewed. If you're curious as to how google does it, <a href ="https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/">press on this link to go to the Google Analytics Homepage.</a> <br><br>

	Because I just inserted the HTML script, this page is not populated with data, but here's a preview of some of the type of data that will be collected!
