 				<h2>Tufts Polyhack 2017</h2>
 					<p>A few weeks ago I participated in Tufts Polyhack with a few friends. This was our first polyhack, and all of learned a ton! We created a platform where solo travelers can connect abroad using the TripAdvisor API. You can check out our project here, but we're still improving it, so it may not always work. </p>

 				<h2>Interface Design</h2>
 				<p>During the spring semester of my Sophomore year, I took a Computer Interface Design Class. Every week we were to design different interfaces. I learned a lot, and you can see the difference by looking at my work at the beginnning of the semester to the end!</p>
