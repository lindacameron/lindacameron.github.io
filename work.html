 				<h2>Verizon Internship</h2>
 				<p>		This past summer (2018), I worked at Verizon as a Data Analtics and Artificial Intelligence intern. I worked on two chatbots over the course of my internship, and learned a great deal about the chatbot sphere. I first worked on the Verizon Career Chatbot which is an external facing platform that is to be used by potential Verizon employee applicants. Users can use the chatbot to get answers to questions about basic application questions. <br> <br>

	 			I then integrated a Google Calendar Service with the already existing Verizon Digital Assistant, which is an internal chatbot used by emploeyes. My work allows Verizon employees to schedule meetings with other employees through the chatbot, and all parties' availabilities will be automatically checked at the given time. If a party is unavailable at the given time, the bot will propose alternative times that will work for all parties. <br><br>

	 			I learned a lot about artificial intelligence and machine learning over the course of my internship, and I enjoyed learning how to use tools such as DialogFlow! <br>

 				<h2>Machine Structure and Assembly Language</h2>
 				<p>In the Fall of 2017 I took COMP40, and I learned a ton. All of our projects are done with partner and some of the projects are below!</p>
 				<ul>
 					<li>Integer and Logical Operations: Created an Image compression/decompression program created by packing/unpacking	binary data	and required the use of	twoâ€™s complement and floating-point arithmetic.</li>
 					<li>The Universal Machine: Emulated a Universal Machine that contained segmented memory, 8 registers, and 14 machine instructions.</li>
 					<li>Binary Bomb: Debugged a binary "bomb" that used AMD64 assembly code.</li>
 					<li>Cache and Locality: Implemented	an interface for blocked 2D	arrays,	and	then	performed image	rotations using	different array	accessing methods, and analyzed	their	performance.</li>

 				<h2>Tufts Polyhack 2017</h2>
 					<p>A few weeks ago I participated in Tufts Polyhack with a few friends. This was our first polyhack, and all of learned a ton! We created a platform where solo travelers can connect abroad using the TripAdvisor API. You can check out our project 
 					<a href = "http://travie17.herokuapp.com/">here,</a> 
 					but we're still improving it, so it may not always work. </p>

 				<h2>Data Structures</h2>
 					<p>In the spring of 2017 I took data structures! Below are some of the projects we worked on.</p>
 					<ul>
 						<li>Grep: Simulated Mac Spotlight feature by indexing and searching a file tree for strings</li>
 					</ul>

 				<h2>Interface Design</h2>
 				<p>During the spring semester of my Sophomore year, I took a Computer Interface Design Class. Every week we were to design different interfaces. I learned a lot, and you can see the difference by looking at my work at the beginnning of the semester to the end!</p>

 				<h2>Design Wars 2016</h2>
 				<p>In October of 2016, I participated in Design Wars, which is a part of Tufts Polyhack. During the design wars, contestants are challenged to design a logo, do branding, or create wireframes. I walked into this never having used Adobe Illustrator or other design apps in my life, but I really wanted to learn so I spent quite a bit of time googling and playing around, and I ended up winning the Logo Design Challenge! My logo is below. </p>
