 				<h2>Machine Structure and Assembly Language</h2>
 				<p>In the Fall of 2017 I took COMP40, and I learned a ton. All of our projects are done with partner and some of the projects are below!</p>
 				<ul>
 					<li>Integer and Logical Operations: Created an Image compression/decompression program created by packing/unpacking	binary data	and required the use of	twoâ€™s complement and floating-point arithmetic.</li>
 					<li>The Universal Machine: Emulated a Universal Machine that contained segmented memory, 8 registers, and 14 machine instructions.</li>
 					<li>Binary Bomb: Debugged a binary "bomb" that used AMD64 assembly code.</li>
 					<li>Cache and Locality: Implemented	an interface for blocked 2D	arrays,	and	then	performed image	rotations using	different array	accessing methods, and analyzed	their	performance.</li>
 				</ul>

 				<h2>Tufts Polyhack 2017</h2>
 					<p>A few weeks ago I participated in Tufts Polyhack with a few friends. This was our first polyhack, and all of learned a ton! We created a platform where solo travelers can connect abroad using the TripAdvisor API. You can check out our project 
 					<a href = "http://travie17.herokuapp.com/">here,</a> 
 					but we're still improving it, so it may not always work. </p>

 				<h2>Data Structures</h2>
 					<p>In the spring of 2017 I took data structures! Below are some of the projects we worked on.</p>
 					<ul>
 						<li>Grep: Simulated Mac Spotlight feature by indexing and searching a file tree for strings</li>
 					</ul>

 				<h2>Interface Design</h2>
 				<p>During the spring semester of my Sophomore year, I took a Computer Interface Design Class. Every week we were to design different interfaces. I learned a lot, and you can see the difference by looking at my work at the beginnning of the semester to the end!</p>

 				<h2>Design Wars 2016</h2>
 				<p>In October of 2016, I participated in Design Wars, which is a part of Tufts Polyhack. During the design wars, contestants are challenged to design a logo, do branding, or create wireframes. I walked into this never having used Adobe Illustrator or other design apps in my life, but I really wanted to learn so I spent quite a bit of time googling and playing around, and I ended up winning the Logo Design Challenge! My logo is below. </p>
